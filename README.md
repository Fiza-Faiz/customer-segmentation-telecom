# Customer Segmentation for Telecommunications

## Project Overview
This project implements customer segmentation using machine learning techniques for a telecommunications company. The goal is to identify distinct customer groups based on their behavior, demographics, and usage patterns to enable targeted marketing strategies and improve customer retention.

## Key Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning for mixed data types (numerical and categorical)
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with comprehensive visualizations
- Implementation of multiple clustering algorithms
- Customer segment profiling and business insights
- Actionable recommendations for business strategies

## Setup Instructions
1. Create a virtual environment: `python -m venv venv`
2. Activate the environment: `source venv/bin/activate` (Linux/Mac) or `venv\Scripts\activate` (Windows)
3. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Launch Jupyter: `jupyter notebook`

## Dataset
We'll be using a publicly available telecommunications customer dataset that includes:
- Customer demographics
- Service usage patterns
- Billing information
- Churn indicators
- Product/service subscriptions

## Methodology
1. **Data Exploration**: Understand data structure, quality, and patterns
2. **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies
3. **Feature Engineering**: Create meaningful features and encode categorical variables
4. **Segmentation**: Apply clustering algorithms to identify customer segments
5. **Validation**: Evaluate segmentation quality and business relevance
6. **Insights**: Generate actionable business recommendations
